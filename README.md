Business Problem 
The placement cell of an educational institution wants to: 
● Predict the likelihood of a student being placed based on specific 
inputs like CGPA, IQ level, Profile Score. 
● Use this prediction to provide timely career guidance, recommend 
interventions (e.g., training, internships), and allocate placement 
resources more effectively. 
While a machine learning model has already been trained to make such 
predictions, non-technical users (like placement officers and faculty 
members) do not have an easy way to access the model’s predictions. 
They need a user-friendly, accessible web interface to use this tool 
effectively.

Objective:
To build and deploy a Student Placement Prediction Web App using Python 
and Flask that enables users to: 
● Enter relevant student information via a simple web form. 
● Receive real-time predictions (e.g., “Placed” or “Not Placed”) using a 
pre-trained machine learning model. 
● Use predictions to make data-informed decisions for career planning 
and support.
